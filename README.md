# ZOMBIE KID!
This was a quick little game originally made for the GMTK 2023 jam, but due to scheduling issues, I couldn't find time to compete in the jam proper, so it's here as a late release. 

The repo is based off the risky-rico repo I recently built with HomeTeamGameDev, so it shares a lot of cruft code with it (slowly removing that though)

# PREMISE
Zombie Kid is about building up an army of friends by giving everyone cute zombie hugs. 

Walk up to a person and make them your friend just by hugging them! The more friends you get, the bigger your group will be. 

More friends let you do group hugs on smaller groups, giving you even more friends! 

But if a group is bigger than yours, they might steal some of your friends. Mean! How greedy! 

Your goal is to make everyone on Earth your friend! Yay! MORE FRIENDS

# RULES
1. Each game starts you off with just one zombie: you
2. Your goal is to keep surviving until youâ€™ve hugged enough people to get 50 friends
3. Move around a level and hug humans to add them to your group
4. If humans in a hugging group outnumber you, you will gradually lose zombies
5. Having 0 zombies = game over
6. Enemies will chase zombies if they outnumber them and will flee if humans are outnumbered
7. Sending out a zombie can attract a larger group; recalling one can lure a smaller group
8. Bigger groups of humans will spawn over time. Be prepared!

# CONTROLS
Arrows/WASD: move

E: select/confirm

Mouse: aim reticle

Left click: send zombie

Right click: recall zombies

# HOW TO RUN
The game will be playable on itch.io soon but for now you can run it by cloning the repo and going to the Game Scene in Unity. If you press the Play button, you should be able to start up a round. However, it's still in development, so many things are still placeholders or just plain broken.
